Completed this project as part of my datascience and machine learning course with united network of professionals(unp).

Key highlights:

Studied and analyzed the quality of red wine dataset to apply machinelearning models and present my insights.

Performed various exploratory data analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.

Experimented with different machine learning algorithms linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, randomforest regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, XG boost.

Compared the results to recommend the best regression model.
